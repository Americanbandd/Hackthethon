Completing Prompt 1: Industrial Engineering
Data centers are key infrastructure in the AI economy, providing servers equipped with high numbers of GPUs needed for high speed model training and serving. Given the recent surge in GPU demand, data centers are struggling to keep up, and hardware failures need to be addressed swiftly. Develop a quality control system to track quality and/or failure in GPU usage across data centers for a system like Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services.

## Project goal

To create a Shinyapp dashboard tool to predict datacenter hardware failures based on trends in GPU temperature, powerdraw, and utilization over time. 

## Project Scope 

We have been contracted by fictional AI company X to develop a tool that will analyze GPU data from their main datacenter, and tell them (coming back later)
