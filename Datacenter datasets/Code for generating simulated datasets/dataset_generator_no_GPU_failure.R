# Simulated GPU data set 
# Group members: Nevin Motto, Evelyne Morisseu, Daniel Carlson, Rene Umeh

# This script simulates GPU performance metrics over 
# multiple GPU racks and time periods. Each data point represents
# the average and peak operating conditions for a single GPU over
# a defined time period. 

# This data set was created to demonstrate our tools functionality and is one of 
# three test datasets. This particular dataset has average temperature,
# memory usage, and power usage values varying in a normal distribution
# around a set mean. 

# Each column in this dataset captures a different dimension of GPU behavior: 
# - GPU_Unique_ID: identifies each individual GPU
# - Rack_ID: groups GPUs by their physical rack
# - Time_Period: time intervals of measurement
# - Average_GPU_Temperature: typical temperature averages sustained (Celsius)
# - Peak_GPU_Temperature: maximum temperature spike in each GPU (Celsius)
# - Average_GPU_Power_Usage: average power draw (watts)
# - Peak_GPU_Power_Usage: Maximum power draw for each GPU (watts)
# - Average_GPU_Memory_Usage: average GPU memory utilization as % of memory
# - Peak_GPU_Memory_Usage: maximum memory usage as % of total memory

# Example dataset parameters:
set.seed(123)  # use for reproducibility of the random data
